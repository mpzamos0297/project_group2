**Problem Definition**

New York City is one of the busiest cities in the world, and parking issues have long been a challenge for both city management and daily life. Each year, the NYC government issues over 10 million parking tickets. Our goal is to extract meaningful insights from this massive dataset of parking violations, analyzing the entire set of tickets issued by the NYC Department of Finance. We aim to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies related to ticket issuance to help both government and businesses make more informed decisions.

The data is collected and published by the NYC Department of Finance to support the handling of violations and policy formulation. This includes understanding how tickets are distributed by location, time, violation type, vehicle characteristics, and enforcement agency. It enables us to analyze traffic violations in the city from various angles. The analysis aims to provide insights to inform policy decisions, improve enforcement efficiency, and support transparency efforts. For example: Which locations need additional signage? Where should more patrol resources be allocated? Which areas need more parking spaces?
